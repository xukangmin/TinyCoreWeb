## Introduction

Open source Arduino supported Attiny1616 breakout board with Programmer. It is small, easy to use and low power consumption. **It has I2C, SPI, UART, PWM, Timers, Touch PINS, ADC, DAC, 16K Flash, 2K SRAM, 256 bytes EEPROM with 8-bit CPU running up to 20MHz all in it's tiny body!** It has the smallest possible bread-board footprint. The programmer boards features USB type-c, JST battery and ESP-01 connectors.

They are avaialbe on Tindie.

### Installation
- Install the current upstream Arduino IDE at the 1.8.7 level or later. The current version is at the [Arduino website](http://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software).
- Start Arduino and open Preferences window.
- Enter ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xukangmin/TinyCore/master/avr/package/package_tinycore_index.json``` into *Additional Board Manager URLs* field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.
- Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and install *TinyCore* platform (and don't forget to select your TinyCore board from Tools > Board menu after installation).

### Arduino Support
  Currently UART, I2C, SPI, basic timer functions like delay, delayMicroseconds, milis, micros are working, I'm working on adding EEPROM support.
